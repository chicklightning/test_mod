Test Modding
========

A git repository for my adventures in Minecraft modding. To be used for modding examples and as a general learning template.

Most mod-related files will be found under src/main/java/, and will be updated periodically.

This particular upload is ready for drag and drop into a "gradle" prepared Forge ModLoader folder; just replace .src and the .gitignore and it should be ok to run in Eclipse.
